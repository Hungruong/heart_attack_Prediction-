# Heart Attack Prediction System
  This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application developed using Python and the Tkinter library. The application is designed to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on various patient data inputs. It utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to make predictions.

## Features
  User-friendly GUI for data input and analysis
  Visualization of patient data through multiple plots
  Prediction of heart attack risk based on input parameters
  Clear display of prediction results
  Additional information about the dataset and its features

## Examples:
  The example image shows the main window of the application, where users can input patient data, view visualizations, and obtain the prediction result.
  1. Patient has heart disease

## Prerequisites
  To run this application, you'll need the following dependencies installed:
  
    Python 3.x
    Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)
    NumPy
    Matplotlib
    Pillow (PIL)
    
  You can install the required Python packages using pip:
    
    pip install numpy matplotlib pillow

## Usage:
  1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    
    git clone https://github.com/Hungruong/heart_attack_Prediction-.git
  2. Navigate to the project directory:
    
    cd heart_attack_Prediction-
  3. Run the main Python script:

    python main.py
  4. The application GUI will open, allowing you to input patient data and analyze the heart attack risk.
     
## Dataset:
  This project utilizes a heart disease dataset containing various features related to patient information and medical test results. The dataset is preprocessed and used to train a machine learning model for prediction purposes.
